Project Description
This is a beginner-friendly, rule-based chatbot built in Python. It responds to basic user inputs such as greetings, time queries, and simple FAQs. The chatbot runs in the terminal and uses simple keyword matching for responses, making it easy to understand and extend. It's designed for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced AI projects.

Features
Greetings: Responds to common greetings like "hello", "hi", or "hey".
Time Queries: Provides the current time when asked (e.g., "what time is it?").
Basic FAQs: Handles questions like "what's your name?" or "how are you?".
Exit Functionality: Ends the conversation when the user says "bye" or "exit".
Rule-Based Responses: Uses simple if-else logic for matching user input, no complex NLP required.
Terminal-Based: Runs entirely in the command line for simplicity.
Screenshots
(Note: Since this is a terminal-based application, screenshots would show the command prompt window with example interactions. You can capture and add images here if desired. For now, here's a text-based example:)
